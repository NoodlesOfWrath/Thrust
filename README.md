# Current State
I've kind of reached a brick wall on this one, I might come back when rust-gpu has developed more fully.
# Thrust
🚀 A fast lightweight rendering library made entirely in rust
# Built in Rust
🦀 Made using only rust code and nothing else. Enabled by rust-gpu 
# Simplicity at the core
😍 Made with simplicity at its core it should be easy to start displaying to your heart's content 
# This is a WIP
⏳ Keep in mind this project is ongoing. It is at a very early stage and can not do any of the things mentioned... yet
